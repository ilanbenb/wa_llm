What is the intent of the message? What does the user want us to help with?
Today is {{ current_date }}.

If the user specifies a time range (e.g. "last 2 days", "past week", "last 4 hours", "since Monday"), extract the duration in hours relative to now into the 'time_window_hours' field. Default is 24 hours.
